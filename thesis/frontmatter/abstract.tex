Traditional keyword-based Search has been popularized by commercial search engines like Google and Bing, where retrieval is heavily dependent on keywords and their frequency in target documents. However, such techniques often fail to capture the informational needs of the users, resulting in failure to retrieve essential information even when it is available. Faceted search enables users to navigate a heterogeneous information space by combining text search with a progressive narrowing of choices along multiple dimensions. However, they suffer from the cold start problem of a non-domain knowledge searcher could not provide any effective keywords for the initial searching. In this paper, we propose a new approach to overcome the latter problem by leveraging facets as an implicit feedback for detection of critical facets to identify the best search results.
