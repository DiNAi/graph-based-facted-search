\label{conclusion}

In this work, we have addressed the problem of how to improve faceted search for navigational and exploratory search by using implicit feedback mechanism and demonstrated an improved exploratory search with an evaluation of the search process. We have show how to use graph based mode to enable a simple faceted search. By using this, we were able to make implicitly existing relations among multiple data sets explicit and to augment the ordinary keyword-based search by presenting additional related information and resources to the user via an appropriate interactive user interface.

Faceted search is at it's early stages as a research data. Currently, there does not exist an overall accepted best-practice neither on how to realize nor on how to evaluate.
